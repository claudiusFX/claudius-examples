This example generates a set of points in the shape of a sphere and a set of rings so they look a little like Jupiter or other ringed planet.

This example is a good example of what could be referred to as a functional style of effect: the points for the data are generated as 3D points in space, they then have a transform applied to generate a new set of points for the rotated planet in 3D space, another transform is applied to these points to project them into 2D for the screen, etc.

This example was original made for day 1 of [Genuary 2024](https://genuary.art/2024/).
